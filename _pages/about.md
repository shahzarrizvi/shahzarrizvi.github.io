I am a PhD student in [Tamara Broderick](https://tamarabroderick.com/)'s group at the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems. Previously, I received my master's in statistics from UC Berkeley in May 2024 and my bachelors' in mathematics, computer science, and statistics from UC Berkeley in December 2021. 

During my master's at Berkeley, I had the pleasure and privilege of working with [Ryan Giordano](https://rgiordan.github.io/about.html) in the Berkeley Department of Statistics, [Benjamin Nachman][(https://nachmangroup.github.io/](https://nachmangroup.github.io/html/People.html)) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and [Nathan Lo]((https://med.stanford.edu/lo-lab/the-lo-team.html)) at Stanford Medicine. Before that, I also had the opportunity to work with PhD students [Jake Soloff](https://jake-soloff.github.io/) and [Runjing Liu](https://runjing-liu120.github.io/) in the Berkeley Department of Statistics during  my undergraduate.

I am broadly interested in Bayesian inference, robust statistics, and trustworthy data science.
